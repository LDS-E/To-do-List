# To-do List

This is my first to-do list project developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main goal of this project is to allow the user to add, edit, and delete tasks from a list. This project was developed to improve my skills in web development and as a demonstration of interacting with the DOM.

## Features

- **Add tasks**: You can add new tasks to the list by typing the task name in the input field and clicking "Add".
- **Mark tasks as completed**: Click on the check icon next to a task to mark it as completed.
- **Edit tasks**: You can edit an existing task by clicking the edit icon.
- **Delete tasks**: You can delete tasks by clicking the trash icon.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Page structure and basic content.
- **CSS**: Styling the interface for a clean and user-friendly appearance.
- **JavaScript**: Logic for adding, editing, deleting, and marking tasks as completed.
